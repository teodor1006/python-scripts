This code defines three classes: `BankAccount`, `InterestRewardsAccount`, and `SavingsAccount`, along with a custom exception class `BalanceException`. Let's dive into the OOP project.

1. **`BalanceException` class:**
   * This is a custom exception class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class.
   * It doesn't have any additional methods or attributes, so it serves as a general exception to handle balance-related issues in the bank account operations.

2. **`BankAccount` class:**
   * The constructor (`__init__`) initializes a bank account with an initial balance (`initialAmount`) and an account name (`accountName`).
   * It has methods:
     * `getBalance`: Prints the current balance of the account.
     * `deposit`: Adds the specified amount to the account balance and prints the updated balance.
     * `viableTransaction`: Checks if a transaction is viable (whether the account has sufficient balance). If not, it raises a `BalanceException`.
     * `withdraw`: Withdraws the specified amount from the account balance if the transaction is viable, else catches the `BalanceException`.
     * `transfer`: Initiates a transfer of a specified amount from the current account to another account. It includes checks for viability and raises a `BalanceException` if necessary.

3. **`InterestRewardsAccount` class:**
   * Inherits from `BankAccount`.
   * Overrides the `deposit` method to add an interest of 5% to the deposited amount.

4. **`SavingsAccount` class:**
   * Inherits from `InterestRewardsAccount`.
   * Extends the constructor to include a `fee` attribute set to 5.
   * Overrides the `withdraw` method to include the fee in the withdrawal amount.

In summary, these classes create a hierarchy of bank account types. The base class `BankAccount` handles common account operations, and the derived classes `InterestRewardsAccount` and `SavingsAccount` add specific behavior like interest rewards and fees. The custom exception `BalanceException` is used to handle balance-related issues during account operations.
